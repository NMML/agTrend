{"name":"agTrend","tagline":"R package for Bayesian inference of trends for aggregated abundance surveys","body":"### Welcome to agTrend.\r\nThis is the future home of the R package *agTrend* for Bayesian inference of trends for aggregated survey data\r\n\r\n#### Installing *agTrend*\r\n\r\nThere are two basic methods to install the agTrend package, from within R itself using the devtools package and downloading a binary appropriate to your operating system. If you are using a windows machine it is possible that you will need [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed to build and install the package. There is no compiled code in agTrend. \r\n\r\n*Using devtools*\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the agTrend package using the GitHub installation function within the devtools R package. If devtools is not installed, it can be installed from CRAN by typing `install.packages(\"devtools\")` from within the R console.\r\n\r\nIf devtools is installed, to install agTrend, open the R console and type\r\n```\r\n> library(devtools)\r\n> install_github(\"agTrend\", username=\"NMML\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Downloading a binary file**\r\n\r\nI have also placed copies of the binary installation files in a Google drive. Follow the following links for your operating system: [Mac OSX](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7NE3XGvDquOblh1YmRsSEVCTFk/edit?usp=sharing) or [Windows](). If you are running a Linux machine, see the following section. *Note*: make sure your browser does not try to automatically unpack the file (this is the default for Safari, go into preferences to change this feature). \r\n\r\nAfter you download the file, open R and set the working directory (e.g., using `setwd(\"path/to/download/dir/\")`). Once this is set, run\r\n\r\n```\r\n> install.packages(\"agTrend.zip\", repos=NULL)\r\n```\r\nIf you have a mac replace with \"agTrend.zip\" with \"agTrend.tgz\".\r\n\r\n*Downloading the source file*\r\nSource files for each version can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7NE3XGvDquORXpfb05xMWw2SHc&usp=sharing). The desired file can be downloaded and installed in the same way as with the binaries, e.g., \r\n\r\n```\r\n> install.packages(\"agTrend_0.11.tar.gz\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Is it installed?**\r\n\r\nHowever you choose to install you should see some output that, hopefully, ends with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* installing *source* package 'agTrend' ...\r\n** R\r\n** data\r\n** demo\r\n** inst\r\n** preparing package for lazy loading\r\n** help\r\n*** installing help indices\r\n** building package indices\r\n** testing if installed package can be loaded\r\n* DONE (agTrend)\r\n```\r\nIn which case, everything is installed.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
