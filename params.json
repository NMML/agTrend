{"name":"agTrend","tagline":"R package for Bayesian inference of aggregated abundance survey trends","body":"# Welcome to agTrend\r\nThis is the future home of the R package *agTrend* for Bayesian inference of trends for aggregated survey data\r\n\r\n## Installing agTrend\r\n\r\nThere are two basic methods to install the agTrend package, from within R itself using the devtools package and downloading a binary appropriate to your operating system. If you are using a windows machine it is possible that you will need [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed to build and install the package. There is no compiled code in agTrend. \r\n\r\n### Using devtools\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the agTrend package using the GitHub installation function within the devtools R package. If devtools is not installed, it can be installed from CRAN by typing `install.packages(\"devtools\")` from within the R console.\r\n\r\nIf devtools is installed, to install agTrend, open the R console and type\r\n```\r\n> library(devtools)\r\n> install_github(\"agTrend\", username=\"NMML\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Downloading a binary file\r\n\r\nI have also placed copies of the [binary installation](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7NE3XGvDquOQ0tRa0xiYmtQN2c&usp=sharing) files in a Google drive. For Windows download the \".zip\" file and for Mac OS X download the \".tgz\" file. If you are running a Linux machine, see the following section. *Note*: make sure your browser does not try to automatically unpack the file (this is the default for Safari, go into preferences to change this feature). \r\n\r\nAfter you download the file, open R and set the working directory (e.g., using `setwd(\"path/to/download/dir/\")`). Once this is set, run\r\n\r\n```\r\n> install.packages(\"agTrend.zip\", repos=NULL)\r\n```\r\nIf you have a mac replace with \"agTrend.zip\" with \"agTrend.tgz\".\r\n\r\n### Downloading the source file\r\nSource files for each version can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7NE3XGvDquORXpfb05xMWw2SHc&usp=sharing). The desired file can be downloaded and installed in the same way as with the binaries, e.g., \r\n\r\n```\r\n> install.packages(\"agTrend_0.12.tar.gz\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is it installed?\r\n\r\nHowever you choose to install you should see some output that, hopefully, ends with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* installing *source* package 'agTrend' ...\r\n** R\r\n** data\r\n** demo\r\n** inst\r\n** preparing package for lazy loading\r\n** help\r\n*** installing help indices\r\n** building package indices\r\n** testing if installed package can be loaded\r\n* DONE (agTrend)\r\n> \r\n```\r\nIn which case, everything is installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using agTrend\r\n\r\nTo begin using agTrend simply open the R console and type \r\n```\r\n> library(agTrend)\r\n```\r\n \r\nFollowing this you should see this output:\r\n```\r\nLoading required package: coda\r\nLoading required package: lattice\r\nLoading required package: Matrix\r\nLoading required package: mgcv\r\nThis is mgcv 1.7-22. For overview type 'help(\"mgcv-package\")'.\r\nLoading required package: truncnorm\r\n\r\n\r\n agTrend 0.12 (2013-04-24) \r\n\r\n Type 'demo(package='agTrend')' to see a list of demos for this package.\r\n BE CAREFUL! The demos take a while as they are running a full MCMC sampler.\r\n\r\n The raw code for the demos can be found by typing:\r\n \t system.file('demo', package='agTrend')\r\n\r\n To access the help files type:\r\n \t help('agTrend-package')\r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n```\r\nIt will throw some errors if the required packages are not installed. Just install these separately using, e.g.,  `install.packages(\"coda\")`. From here you can run the demos on Steller sea lion trends with, e.g., `demo(wdpsNonpups)`. This will take a while because it will run the entire MCMC augmentation!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
