\title{Recalculate new site aggregations from a previous MCMC aggregation}
\usage{
newAggregation(fit, aggregation.data, type = "pred")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{The output list from a previous call to \code{\link{mcmc.aggregate}}.
In order to use this function, \code{keep.site.abund = TRUE} had to be used in the original creation of \code{fit}. Else,
there is nothing to be aggregated!}

\item{aggregation.data}{A data frame with the sites in one column 
(with the same name as \code{site.name} used in the original call to create \code{fit}). The other columns
are factor variables defining other site aggregations.}

\item{type}{Which site abundance augmentation should be used, \code{"pred"} for posterior
predictive or \code{"rel"} for realized (just the posterior).}
}
\value{
A named list with names equal to the variables in \code{aggregation.data}. Each
element of the list is another list with elements:
\item{aggregated.abund}{The MCMC sample of the new aggregation}
\item{aggregation.summary}{A summary of the aggregation MCMC}
}
\description{
If the site abundence sample was retained in a call to \code{\link{mcmc.aggregate}} the 
sites can be re-aggregated according to different region specifications.
